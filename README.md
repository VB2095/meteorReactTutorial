I followed the Meteor Tutorial with React from : https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/ to learn a bit more about Meteor and React. Decided to put it on GitHub for showcase. I may add some features in the future. 

To run the app : 
get in the folder : 

cd simple-todos

run meteor with the cmd : meteor

It should now run on : http://localhost:3000 

Enjoy.
